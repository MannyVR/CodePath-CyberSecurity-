## Pentesting Report

1. Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Summary: Current versions of WordPress are vulnerable to a stored XSS. An unauthenticated attacker can inject JavaScript in WordPress comments. The script is triggered when the comment is viewed. If triggered by a logged-in administrator, under default settings the attacker can leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server via the plugin and theme editors. Alternatively the attacker could change the administratorâ€™s password, create new administrator accounts, or do whatever else the currently logged-in administrator can do on the target system.  
    - Vulnerability types: XSS
    - Tested in version: 4.2, 4.1.2, 4.1.1, 3.9.3 
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: https://gph.is/2IgKfUu 
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: Reading the above vulnerabilty, this is how I went about it,
        1) I looked up the vulnerabilty in this website https://klikki.fi/adv/wordpress2.html
        2) I copied the code that shows the vulnerabilty for the XSS attack. 
            ***<a title='x onmouseover=alert(unescape(/hello%20world/.source)) style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;                height:5000px  AAAAAAAAAAAA...[64 kb]..AAA'></a>***
        3) I as a user injected the above code into the the comments section. In this scenerio I was the attacker. Injecting the code      
           above exploited the vulnerability. It displays a "Hello World" box whenever a user loads a page.
  - [ ] Affected source code:
     <textarea id="comment" name="comment" cols="45" rows="8" aria-describedby="form-allowed-tags" aria-required="true"      required="required" data-gramm="true" data-txt_gramm_id="bd582786-fe34-3cf3-2756-b92e2409e51c" data-gramm_id="bd582786-fe34-3cf3-2756-b92e2409e51c" spellcheck="false" data-gramm_editor="true" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0% !important; z-index: auto; position: relative; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; transition: none 0s ease 0s;"></textarea>
