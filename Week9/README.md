**Week 9 Honey Pot Analysis:**
**Which Honeypot(s) you deploy?**
Dionaea

**Any issues you encounterd**
The most difficult challenge that I encountered while working on this challenge was getting the UI to be accessible via the 
web browser. This took a very long time, however after analyzing the information I learned that the mistake that I was  
that I was not installing the honeypot on the server. That was a problem. I was attempting to install the honey pot on my 
main machine. 

**Summary:**
Honey Pots are very important and can be crucial to protect our infrustructures. By implementing honeypots we are able to analyze 
how attackers are scanning our network. It is very interesting because once you analyze some of the honeypots youll see that 
there are many bots that are communicating to your machine from around the world. This shows you the intricate dangers that lie
in the internet. 
By looking at the traffic which is listed below in Milestone 5, you can see that there were a lot of attacks coming from within the
U.S. However shortly after the HoneyPot was set up I started get many attacks from different countries such as  Russia and China!
This didnt take long. 
If you look below, you will be able to see the milestones.

**Unresolved questions?**
I would really like to learn more about creating more effective honeypots, It is a very powerful concept. I would like to know
how I can trace back hackers. This is something I will be researching more.
